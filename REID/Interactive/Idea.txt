basic game idea
- instead of rock, paper scissor have jarvis make certain movements (left, right, foward)
- Invite perticipants to play against Jarvis by picking one of the three.
	- the fisheye lenses can be used, if the participant picks a position and jarvis randomly guesses
	a direction. If the camera captures the image of a person or the sensor pick up the presence by
	using Obstical avoidance, Jarvis will emote one of 2 responses, (celebrate or fail)
